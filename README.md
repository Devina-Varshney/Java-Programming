# Java Programming

This repository contains all the java programming assignments for the CSE1007 lab as of Winter'19.

## Assignment 1
1. WAP for finding the max and min among three numbers.
2. WAP, which takes two integer operands and one operator from the user, performs the operation and then prints the result. (Consider the operators `+, - ,*, /, %` and use `switch` Statement)
3. WAP to find the sum of individual digits of a positive integer and test given number is palindrome.
4. WAP to generate all the prime numbers between 1 and n, where n is a value supplied by the user.
5. Write a program that calls a function `gcd(m,n)` which returns the greatest common divisor of the two values m and n.
6. WAP to find the minimum and maximum integer in a list of integers. (Use array)
7. WAP that uses functions to perform the following based on the user’s choice: (Use 2d array)
    * Addition of Two Matrices
    * Multiplication of Two Matrices 
8. WAP that uses functions to perform the following operations: (Use functions)
    * To insert a substring in to a given main string from a given position.
    * To delete n Characters from a given position in a given string.
9. WAP to determine if the given string is a palindrome or not.

## Assignment 2
1. Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in multidimensional arrays and looping constructs.
    >Eg., If there are 4 batches in BTech - “CSE1007” course, read the count of the slow learners (who have scored <25) in each batch. Tutors should be assigned in the ratio of 1:4 (For every 4 slow learners, there should be one tutor). Determine the number of tutors for each batch. Create a 2-D jagged array with 4 rows to store the count of slow learners in the 4 batches. The number of columns in each row should be equal to the number of groups formed for that particular batch ( Eg., If there are 23 slow learners in a batch, then there should be 6 tutors and in the jagged array, the corresponding row should store  4, 4, 4, 4, 4,3). Use for-each loop to traverse the array and print the details. Also print the number of batches in which all tutors have exactly 4 students.
2. Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in String handling.
    >Eg., Write a program to read a chemical equation and find out the count of the reactants and the products. Also display the count of the number of molecules of each reactant and product.
    >Eg., For the equation, 2NaOH + H2SO4 -> Na2SO4+ 2H2O,  the O/P  should be as follows: (1) Reactants are 2 moles of NaOH,  1 mole of H2SO4. (2) Products are 1 mole of Na2SO4 and 2 moles of H2O.
3. Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in Inheritance.
    > Eg: Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called as savings account and the other as current account. The savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. The current account provides cheque book facility but no interest. Current account holders should maintain a minimum balance and if the balance falls below this level, a service charge is imposed.
    Create a class account that stores customer name, account number and type of account. From this derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acct to make them more specific to their requirements. Include necessary member functions in order to achieve the following tasks :
    * Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance.
    * Display the balance
    * Compute and deposit interest.
    * Permit withdrawal and update the balance.
    * Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, necessary, and update the balance.
